        <p>The KTM 390 Duke and RC 390 are 399 cc (24.3 cu in)[2] displacement single-cylinder engine motorcycles assembled by Bajaj Auto, and KTM Asia Motorcycle Manufacturing, Inc. (KAMMI) for the Austrian manufacturer KTM.[1] The bikes were developed under a joint program of Bajaj and KTM engineers, in which the concept was developed in Austria, while everything else, including design and final product development, was done in India by Bajaj.[8] The 390 Duke standard debuted at the 2012 EICMA show in Milan, Italy, and went on sale in India and the Philippines in 2013 and in the US in 2015.[7][9][10] The RC 390 sport bike was presented at EICMA the following year.[11] After the Duke's initial release, KTM CEO Stefan Pierer announced plans to export the 390 Duke to the US for 2014.[12][13] Bajaj said eventually the bike will be sold in 80 countries worldwide.[14]</p>

        <p>Motorcycle Consumer News tested the 390 Duke's top speed to be 167.4 km/h (104.0 mph), with acceleration from 0 to 97 km/h (0 to 60 mph) in 5.53 seconds, and 0 to 1⁄4 mi (0.00 to 0.40 km) in 14.02 seconds at 147.87 km/h (91.88 mph).[4] The brakes stopped the bike from 97 to 0 km/h (60 to 0 mph) in 43.1 m (141.3 ft), and fuel economy was tested at 3.97 L/100 km; 71.2 mpg‑imp (59.3 mpg‑US).[4] The 390 Duke weighed 153 kg (338 lb) wet and the engine power was 30.04 kW (40.29 hp) at 9,600 rpm, with 32.92 N⋅m (24.28 ft⋅lb) torque @ 7,000 rpm.[4] The brakes were considered to be "the most obvious flaw on the 390".[20]</p>
